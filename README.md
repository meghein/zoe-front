# Zoe Greenwald

Portfolio built with svelte clientside and a decoupled drupal server

## Get started

Fork and clone this project, then install the dependencies...

```bash
cd project-directory
yarn install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `yarn run start`.

## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

## Using TypeScript

This template comes with a script to set up a TypeScript development environment, you can run it immediately after cloning the template with:

```bash
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

Or remove the script via:

```bash
rm scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```
